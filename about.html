          <h1> Our Story </h1>
            <p>In Littleton, Colorado, against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains, a group of friends united by a passion for gaming decided in 2013 to establish their own gaming company. Starting with a small office space downtown, they began brainstorming game ideas fueled by local coffee and enthusiasm. They handled every aspect of game development, from coding to storytelling, under the moniker "The Littleton Game Collective." Their debut title‚Äîa whimsical puzzle adventure set in a fictionalized Littleton‚Äîshowcased their hometown's charm. As their innovative approach gained attention, they expanded their team and explored new projects, earning recognition for their creativity and community involvement. Today, The Littleton Game Collective continues to thrive, driven by their dedication to storytelling and pushing indie gaming boundaries worldwide.</p>

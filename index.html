                <h3>Colorado -- My Home State</h3>
                <img src="images/colorado.png" alt="Colorado Mountains">
                <p>Colorado, a western U.S. state, has a diverse landscape of arid desert, river canyons and snow-covered Rocky Mountains, which are partly protected by Rocky Mountain National Park. Elsewhere, Mesa Verde National Park features Ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings. Perched a mile above sea level, Denver, Colorado‚Äôs capital and largest city, features a vibrant downtown area. The region has been inhabited by Native Americans and their ancestors for at least 13,500 years and possibly much longer. The eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. In 1848, much of the Nuevo M√©xico region was annexed to the United States with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The Pike's Peak Gold Rush of 1858‚Äì1862 created an influx of settlers. On February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act creating the Territory of Colorado, and on August 1, 1876, President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state. The Spanish adjective "colorado" means "colored red" or "ruddy". Colorado is nicknamed the "Centennial State" because it became a state one century (and four weeks) after the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. </p>

                    <p>The Denver Colorado Temple is located south of Denver in a beautiful residential neighborhood in the suburb of Centennial. Notable features of the striking white temple and its grounds are thousands of colorful flowers in the growing season, a calming water feature bordered by benches, a wall of colorful stained glass above the temple entrance, and a gold-leafed statue of the angel Moroni atop the heaven-reaching spire.</p>

                    <p>Surrounded by lush Hawaiian flora on a gently rising hill that features cascading pools and a large fountain, the Laie Hawaii Temple graces the north shore of Oahu just a half mile from the Pacific Ocean. Travelers along Kamehameha Highway can't miss the striking Hale Laa Boulevard that leads the short distance from the highway to the temple. The exquisite boulevard features a tropical garden on one end and palm trees and decorative lights on the other. Sharing the temple grounds is a highly visited public visitors' center. Down the street is Church-owned Brigham Young University‚ÄìHawaii and Hawaii's number-one paid attraction, the Polynesian Cultural Center.</p>
